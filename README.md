## Introduction:
I am **Ruhul Amin** , a dedicated student currently pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) in my 5th semester at Green University of Bangladesh. My academic journey has fueled a strong passion for web development, where I focus on building dynamic and efficient websites. Additionally, I enjoy participating in programming contests, solving complex algorithmic problems, and continuously improving my problem-solving skills.

Beyond academics, I am skilled in Adobe Photoshop, Adobe Illustrator, and Office 365, which complement my technical pursuits with creativity and productivity. I am also honing my expertise in online browsing to explore emerging trends and expand my knowledge.

I am highly enthusiastic about volunteering for social causes, as I believe itâ€™s a great way to give back to the community while developing leadership and teamwork skills. I am committed to continuous learning, self-improvement, and contributing to both my personal and professional growth.
